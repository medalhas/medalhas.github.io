      <description>About me Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Luis Medalhas. I&amp;rsquo;ve been in software engineering for more than 20 years. Throughout my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked from small companies to large corporations, each of them contributing to my growth.&#xA;For 4 years, I had the opportunity to work as an engineering lead, a position that allowed me to mix my passion for managing people with my love for technical challenges.

      <description>What is feedback and why is important? Feedback, by definition, is information given to someone about their performance or behavior to help them to improve and thrive in the future.&#xA;Positive feedback vs Negative feedback Commonly we use the terms positive feedback or negative feedback, I don&amp;rsquo;t love those terms, good feedback can&amp;rsquo;t be negative.&#xA;I prefer to split them by the objective, so we have:&#xA;Growth feedback Praise feedback Growth feedback They have different objectives, the first one is to help the subject to improve and grow in their career, it&amp;rsquo;s fundamental for a manager to give growth feedback.</description>
