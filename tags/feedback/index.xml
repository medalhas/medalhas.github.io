      <description>What is feedback and why is important? Feedback, by definition, is information given to someone about their performance or behavior to help them to improve and thrive in the future.

I prefer to split them by the objective, so we have:
Growth feedback Praise feedback Growth feedback They have different objectives, the first one is to help the subject to improve and grow in their career, it&amp;rsquo;s fundamental for a manager to give growth feedback.</description>
