<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<p>Hi, I&rsquo;m Luis Medalhas. I&rsquo;ve been in software engineering for more than 20 years. Throughout my career, I&rsquo;ve worked from small companies to large corporations, each of them contributing to my growth.</p>
<p>For 4 years, I had the opportunity to work as an engineering lead, a position that allowed me to mix my passion for managing people with my love for technical challenges. While I thrived in leading teams, I tried for staying connected with the technical stuff of the projects, ensuring that I remain hands-on with the development process.</p>
<p>As software engineer, I worked mainly as a backend engineer, working in languages like Java and C#, I&rsquo;ve tackled several projects, boosting my problem-solving skills, to deliver robust and efficient solutions to our customers.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had interest in topics like leadership and productivity. Whether it&rsquo;s implementing new strategies to enhance my team performance or exploring ways to optimize workflows, I&rsquo;m constantly seeking ways to improve myself and all the people around me.</p>
<p>My journey in software engineering has been a path of learning, growth, and exploration. I&rsquo;m grateful for the experiences that shaped me into the professional I am today, and I look forward to the opportunities and future challenges.</p>
<p>I also would love to write more, it helps me to structure my thoughts and at the same time share some opinios or knowledge about some topic, unfortunely I don&rsquo;t write very often but it&rsquo;s a personal goal for this year.</p>
<h2 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
<p>As hobbies, I love photography, loosing my self in capturing the beauty of the world around me, through my lens.
Also, in the past I was involved in swimming for many years, served as a referee for national and international open-water and swimming competitions, this worked as an incubator to improve my skills on managing teams, managing conflicts and also stress management.</p>
